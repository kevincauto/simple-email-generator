Simple Email Generator
===============

The Purpose
-----------
This app is meant to make putting together templated emails quick and easy.

This version of the app can handle simple templates.  This app lacks the flexibility add, delete, change, and drag email sections.  For these attributes, check out my "email-generator" project.

This works really well for all the simple webinar templated emails that are currently pre-loaded!

Getting Started
---------------
Start by cloning the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/kevincauto/email-generator.git
```
Navigate to inside the project folder within the terminal.
Then install all the node package dependencies needed to run the app using:
```
npm install
```
Start the local development server:
```
npm start
```
